      <hr style="height:1px;background-color:black;">

      <p>This year more than <a href="https://www.hungervolunteer.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/New%20York%20Annual%20Hunger%20Report.pdf"> one in five Bronx residents (23.1%) </a> are experiencing food insecurity. Food insecurity has always
        been an issue in the Bronx and has remained the hungriest
        borough for years.
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hungerfreeamerica.org/about/staff"> Nicole Aber </a> is the director of communication and development at Hunger Free America. She has a passion for raising awareness about food insecurity in New York City. At Hunger
        Free America her team is currently <a href="https://www.hungerfreeamerica.org/nationalhungerclock"> advocating for the next federal relief bill </a> which will help provide funding to food pantries and soup kitchens.

              food sites in the area have reported turning away people, reducing the amount of food distributed per person or limiting their hours of operation due to not having enough resources to support demand this year. </p>

      <p> Aber stated that even with this funding, “There really is not going to be a short term fix. Were really expecting the effects of the crisis, specifically food insecurity to last at least a year if not longer.”
      </p>

      <p>“Whenever there is a big economic crisis like this, we know that low income people are affected the most and the repercussions are longer lasting.”
